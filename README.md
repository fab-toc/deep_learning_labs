## LAB 2

### Q1

Values of gradient:

### Q2

Final values after training:

### Q3 & Q4

_Plots of loss over epochs & original/predicted data_

## LAB 3

### Q1

Number of parameters of the network: 8060

### Q2

_Plots of loss over epochs_
Test accuracy of 68%

### Q3

Accuracy of 86%
Recommend to use ReLU

### Q4

_See plot of hidden size_
I would use a hidden size of 10 because we have a good accuracy with little width of hidden layers. A hidden size of 50 adds a lot of computing and does not add so much in accuracy.
